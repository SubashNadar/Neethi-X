# Nya-AI design: Sage & Clay

Replaced the Orbit navy and brass theme on 2026-10-30. The owner found Orbit too aggressive and asked
for a pleasant palette. Orbit's menu, layout and alignment stay exactly as they were (trace panel,
cited ¶ answer, temporal panel, consult plan, call room, 40px grid); **only colours changed**. New
control styling or behaviour is proposed below and applied only after the owner approves it.

## Sources studied

- **Radix Colors** (MIT, https://github.com/radix-ui/colors): the sage, jade, sand and amber scales
  set the neutrals, the action colour and the warning tones, and their step 11/12 rule for text
  contrast.
- **Magic UI** (MIT, https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui): border beam, shimmer button, magic
  card and highlighter, the basis of the proposed controls. They would be rewritten as plain CSS
  because Magic UI targets Tailwind 4 and `next-themes`, and this app is Tailwind 3.
- **shadcn/ui** (MIT): token names and the button and badge components were already in place.

## Palette

| Token (Tailwind name) | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bg` | `#F6F4EE` | warm paper page background, faint dot grid, soft jade and clay wash |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | cards, panels |
| `soft`, `line`, `input` | `#EEEBE3`, `#E3DFD5`, `#D5D0C4` | quiet fills and borders |
| `ink`, `body3`, `body2`, `muted`, `faint` | `#1C2321` to `#6F7773` | text; `faint` still passes 4.5:1 on white |
| `primary` | `#1E6B5C` (jade) | actions, active nav, focus ring; white text 6.3:1 |
| `primary-tint` | `#E3F1EC` | active nav and tab pill |
| `brass` (now clay) | `#E0894A` | attention: answer edge, dots, marker, beam |
| `brass-light` (clay text) | `#A4551F` | mono labels and citation numbers; 5.4:1 on white |
| `brass-soft`, `brass-glow` | `#FCEFE3`, `#F2B184` | tinted tiles, highlights on dark panels |
| `navy-*` (now deep jade) | `#0F2E28` to `#2E6E60` | only the login hero panel |

The old token names (`navy`, `brass`) are kept so no page had to be rewritten; the comments in
`tailwind.config.js` say what each now holds.

## Proposed controls (declined 2026-10-31)

The owner chose Orbit's layout with Sage & Clay colours and none of these controls. Kept here for
reference only.

Built once in d12d908, then taken out in the next commit because the owner wants layout and
behaviour unchanged until each one is approved. The code is in d12d908 if one is approved.

1. **Beam composer**: a slow jade-to-clay light travels round the chat box; faster on focus.
2. **Tactile keys**: primary buttons look raised and sink 2px on press, with a light sweep on hover.
3. **Spotlight cards**: a soft clay glow follows the pointer on chat starter and lawyer cards.
4. **Sliding pills**: the login role switch and lawyer filters slide between options (the sidebar
   already does this).
5. **Marker highlight**: a clay highlighter stroke draws under a headline's key word.
6. **Floating phone tab dock** with a clay dot on the active tab (changes the phone layout).
7. **Logo halo**: a pulsing ring round the logo on the empty chat.

All would stop under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Not done yet

- No dark mode. The tokens are plain hex, so a dark mode would first move them to CSS variables.
- The Orbit canvas artifact still shows the old navy theme; the app is now the reference for colour.
