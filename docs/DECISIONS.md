# Nya-AI decisions

Product decisions that the code depends on. Newest first. Older entries came from the app's earlier
life under another name; the full history is in git.

## Sage & Clay theme (2026-10-30)

The owner found the Orbit navy and brass theme too aggressive. The app now uses a light "Sage &
Clay" palette (warm paper, jade actions, clay highlights). Orbit's menu, layout and alignment are
unchanged: only colours changed. New control styling (beam composer, tactile keys, spotlight cards,
sliding pills, marker, floating dock) is a proposal list in `docs/DESIGN.md`, applied one by one
only after the owner approves it. Light only for now.

## Backend layout (2026-10-30)

All Python is one uv project in `backend/` with one package, `app`, laid out by layer: `api/`
(routers and schemas), `core/` (settings, security, Langfuse), `db/` (app database), `services/`,
`agents/` (LangGraph, R1), `rag/` (law library) and `evals/`. One `.env` holds the API and agent
settings; the law library's Postgres URL is `VECTOR_DATABASE_URL` so it does not clash with the
app's `DATABASE_URL`. This replaces the two-package workspace (`backend/api`, `backend/agent`) of
earlier the same day.

## Agent service R0: law library (2026-10-29)

- One Document per act; the docstore uses `UPSERTS`, so re-ingesting one act never touches another
  (`UPSERTS_AND_DELETE` would delete every act not in the run).
- Dates are ISO strings in metadata, with `9999-12-31` for "still in force", so the as-of filter is
  two string comparisons. The IPC applies up to 30 June 2024; BNS, BNSS and BSA from 1 July 2024.
- Langfuse is self-hosted (v3) in `backend/docker-compose.yml`, sharing the pgvector Postgres server
  in its own `langfuse` database. Tracing switches off when no Langfuse keys are set.
- `section_map` starts with ten rows the app and golden set use, all `verified=false` until checked
  against the MHA comparison table. `offence_class` stays empty until a public source is loaded.

## Consult plan and call room (2026-10-29)

Users can write a short brief (topic, facts, questions, goals) before booking. It is optional, stays
in the browser tab until booking, then travels with the booking and is visible only to the user and
the booked advocate. The booking `topic` comes from the brief. Document upload is not offered until
there is private file storage. The call room opens for paid or accepted bookings. There is no video
provider yet, so the room says plainly that the advocate phones the client; notes stay on the
device. The law library admin screen is not built until the ingestion pipeline exists, so it never
shows invented progress.

## Public information pages (2026-10-29)

Legal, About, Contact and Help are public routes, so a signed-out visitor can read the disclaimer and
privacy notice before signing in. The policy text is a draft and says so; an advocate must review it
before launch. Contact messages are stored by `POST /api/support` with no login and no automated
reply. Rights requests (data summary, deletion) go through the Contact form with the topic "Privacy
or data" until self-serve buttons exist. The About page states no library numbers, because the
indexed library does not exist yet.

## Orbit theme in the app (2026-10-29)

The whole app uses the Orbit dark theme through the Tailwind tokens: navy background with a brass
grid, brass primary buttons with dark text, Fraunces headings, JetBrains Mono for metadata. The chat
screen follows the Orbit layout: a reasoning-trace panel, ¶-numbered answers with numbered sources,
and a temporal-jurisdiction panel that works out IPC or BNS from the incident date (BNS from
1 July 2024). Until the agent is built, the trace shows only real steps of the keyword engine and a
"basic mode" note, and the IPC to BNS concordance shows four examples, labelled as such.

## Rebrand to Nya-AI (2026-10-29)

The app is now Nya-AI only. The Python package is `nya_ai`, the dev database is `nya_ai.db` and the
browser token key is `nya_ai_token` (existing local sign-ins end once). The old design export, UI
reference, build guardrails and pitch documents were removed. The Orbit design canvas is the UI
reference from now on: https://claude.ai/artifact/QYs5pGyrFcvACgYUWrUp1g

## Real Razorpay integration (2026-07-18)

- Payment details are entered in Razorpay's hosted Checkout.js modal. The method picker on the
  payment screen only pre-selects a tab (`prefill.method`).
- Lawyer payouts are settled manually from the `lawyer_share` field. Razorpay Route is not used.
- Unset Razorpay keys return `503` from the payment endpoints only; the rest of the app still runs.
- A `payment.failed` webhook leaves the booking at `pending_payment` so the user can retry.
- On retry, `create_order` reuses the existing `created` order and updates `method` to the latest
  choice.
- Badge copy is "Razorpay · secure".

## Resolution pass with user (2026-07-18)

1. Mobile Bookings and Profile tabs have their own screens (`/bookings`, `/account`). Profile is
   account info and sign-out only.
2. Lawyer message endpoints kept as built.
3. Lawyer mobile tab labels kept as built.
4. `POST /api/auth/otp/verify` takes an optional `role`. `role="lawyer"` matches an existing lawyer by
   phone and never creates one. The seeded lawyer Meera Krishnan has phone `1234567890`.
5. Guest login as the demo lawyer kept as built.
6. Pending: real bio and Bar Council ID for Adv. Rohan Deshpande, Adv. Sana Qureshi and Adv. Arjun
   Nair. Placeholders stay in `seed.py` until supplied.
7. `Booking` keeps `client_name`, `client_initials` and `topic`.
8. `PATCH /api/messages/threads/{id}/read` is the only way to clear a thread's unread flag.
9. JWTs expire after 24 hours, carry a `jti`, and `POST /api/auth/logout` revokes them at once.
   Phone numbers are normalised to the last 10 digits. Booking refs are `NX-YYYYMMDD-###` per UTC day.

## Messages endpoints (2026-07-17)

The lawyer inbox needed `/api/messages/*` endpoints that the first API plan did not list. Both the
backend and the frontend added the same shapes; they are kept.

## Mobile sign-out (2026-07-17)

Sign-out lives on the mobile Account screen, so a phone user is never stuck signed in.
